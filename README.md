This downloadable app is able to simulate polymerase chain reactions in DNA. It was created in order to ease synthetic biologist's lives when designing primers and conducting an experiment in silico. I created this platform for Dr. John Anderson's Synthetic Biology Lab course at UC Berkeley - BioE 140L.
